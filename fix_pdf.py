==========
Pre-process a garbled medical MCQ PDF (MARROW ED8 series) before the extraction
pipeline runs.

One problem is fixed by default (OCR is an optional extra):

  STEP 1  Remove ANY repeated watermark from a PDF with PyMuPDF (generic -
          works for any book, not just the itachibot series):
            * full-page image XObject families (several pixel variants of the
              same watermark - e.g. 82% + 18% - are one family);
            * unique-per-page raster overlays: tools that bake the watermark
              into a NEW raster per page produce a 100%-coverage image per
              page with different pixels; when they cover >=98% of pages AND
              pages hold visible vector content AND the images are rotated or
              light-gray AND the bitmap is a mostly-empty STAMP (<=1% ink -
              a slide/scan background image with ~2%+ ink is content and is
              never removed), all of them are one watermark family;
            * same-position images repeated on >=90% of pages covering >=25%
              of the page area (banners);
            * full-page Form XObjects repeated on >=90% of pages (vector text
              / painted-band watermarks);
            * inline images (BI...ID...EI) repeated on pages;
            * known watermark text needles ("Sold by", "itachibot",
              "you purchased", "not for distribution", ...), any text span
              repeated on >=90% of pages that is rotated (diagonal), large or
              known, and same-position text families (wording may differ per
              page) redacted at their exact bbox.
            * raster-baked watermarks: whenever full-page bitmaps cover
              (almost) every page and no other channel proved a removable
              object, the watermark may be burned INTO the pixels - a
              per-pixel consensus mask finds a light-gray overlay at the same
              normalized position on >=75% of sampled pages; only those pixels
              (within the band, carved away from solid gray figures/columns,
              dark content and margin furniture) are filled with the page's
              paper tone and the image is re-encoded as JPEG.  This also
              covers slide decks / scans that carry a searchable or invisible
              OCR text layer mentioning the watermark, and pages with visible
              vector text on top of a background bitmap.  No consistent
              pattern -> refused untouched.
          Legitimate content is protected: small corner logos, one-off
          figures, page numbers and header/footer furniture stay untouched,
          and image-only scanned pages without a provable watermark are
          refused with a clear message (never damaged).
          Intermediate output: step1_no_watermark.pdf

  STEP 2  OPTIONAL - rebuild a searchable text layer with OCRmyPDF
          (--force-ocr).  OFF by default: OCR re-renders every page at high
          DPI, so the output becomes many times larger than the upload, and
          on low-DPI scans (e.g. iLovePDF-compressed files at ~55 DPI) the
          recognized words are often wrong.  If OCR is disabled, the final
          PDF is exactly the watermark-free original (visuals + size like
          the upload).  Enable with --ocr (or the dashboard checkbox).

  STEP 3  Verify the output: pdftotext sample pages + watermark strings scan;
          in OCR mode readability is checked too.  A summary is printed.

Usage
-----
    python3 fix_pdf.py /data/input_pdfs/OPH.pdf          # watermark removal only
    python3 fix_pdf.py OPH.pdf --ocr                     # add OCR text layer
    python3 fix_pdf.py OPH.pdf --ocr --language eng      # Hindi pack missing
    python3 fix_pdf.py OPH.pdf --skip-ocr                # same as default

Output
------
    <input dir>/<name>_CLEAN.pdf          final clean PDF
    <input dir>/step1_no_watermark.pdf    watermark-free intermediate (kept by default)

Environment
-----------
    pip install pymupdf ocrmypdf pytesseract reportlab
    apt-get install -y tesseract-ocr tesseract-ocr-hin ghostscript poppler-utils
    (unpaper is optional and only used by ocrmypdf --clean)
